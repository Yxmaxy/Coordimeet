# Coordimeet
Coordimeet is a web service that enables you to easily organise events, invite friends and track activities.

For development and production instructions please refer to the documentation in the [docs](https://github.com/Yxmaxy/Coordimeet/tree/main/docs) folder.

The code which was used as part of my thesis is located on the [diplomska](https://github.com/Yxmaxy/Coordimeet/tree/diplomska) branch.
